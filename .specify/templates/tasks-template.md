# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests follow our testing standards: NUnit for all tests, FakeItEasy for mocking, Testcontainers for integration tests. Tests are written FIRST (TDD) and must fail before implementation.

**Test Naming**: Test classes named `<ClassUnderTest>Should` (e.g., `CharacterServiceShould`). Test methods use Capital_snake_case describing outcomes (e.g., `Return_character_id_when_valid`). No Arrange-Act-Assert comments - structure should be self-evident.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on Interaction-Driven Design (IDD) architecture:

- **Domain Layer**: `Domain/` - Entities, domain services, repository interfaces
- **Application Layer**: `Application/` - Use cases, orchestration (I[UseCase] interface + implementation)
- **Presentation Layer** (choose per feature):
  - **API**: `API/` - ASP.NET Core Web API endpoints
  - **Web**: `Web/Components/` - Blazor components and pages
- **Infrastructure Layer**: `Infrastructure/` - Repository implementations, external services
- **Unit Tests**: `Tests.Unit/[Layer]/` - NUnit tests with FakeItEasy mocks
- **Integration Tests**: `Tests.Integration/Acceptance/` - Testcontainers-based integration tests

**Communication Rule**: API and Web MUST communicate with Domain through Application layer only.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è **TDD: Write FIRST, Ensure FAIL**

> **MANDATORY**: These tests MUST be written before implementation, MUST fail initially, then pass after implementation

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Unit tests for [Domain Entity/Service] using NUnit in Tests.Unit/Domain/[name]Tests.cs
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Unit tests for [Application Use Case] using NUnit & FakeItEasy in Tests.Unit/Application/[name]Tests.cs
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Integration test for [API/Web endpoint] using Testcontainers in Tests.Integration/Acceptance/[name]Tests.cs

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity] in Domain/[Entity].cs
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Create [Repository Interface] in Domain/Repositories/I[Name]Repository.cs
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [Use Case] in Application/[UseCase].cs (depends on T013, T014)
- [ ] T016 [US1] Implement [Repository] in Infrastructure/[Name]Repository.cs
- [ ] T017 [US1] Implement [API endpoint] in API/[Feature].cs OR [Web component] in Web/Components/[Feature].razor
- [ ] T018 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T019 [US1] Verify all tests pass (green phase of TDD)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Unit tests for [Domain Entity/Service] using NUnit in Tests.Unit/Domain/[name]Tests.cs
- [ ] T021 [P] [US2] Unit tests for [Application Use Case] using NUnit & FakeItEasy in Tests.Unit/Application/[name]Tests.cs
- [ ] T022 [P] [US2] Integration test for [API/Web endpoint] using Testcontainers in Tests.Integration/Acceptance/[name]Tests.cs

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] in Domain/[Entity].cs

- [ ] T027 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
- [ ] T028 [US2] Verify all tests pass

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 ‚ö†Ô∏è **TDD: Write FIRST, Ensure FAIL**

- [ ] T029 [P] [US3] Unit tests for [Domain Entity/Service] using NUnit in Tests.Unit/Domain/[name]Tests.cs
- [ ] T030 [P] [US3] Unit tests for [Application Use Case] using NUnit & FakeItEasy in Tests.Unit/Application/[name]Tests.cs
- [ ] T031 [P] [US3] Integration test for [API/Web endpoint] using Testcontainers in Tests.Integration/Acceptance/[name]Tests.cs

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] in Domain/[Entity].cs
- [ ] T033 [US3] Implement [Use Case] in Application/[UseCase].cs
- [ ] T034 [US3] Implement [API endpoint] in API/[Feature].cs OR [Web component] in Web/Components/[Feature].razor
- [ ] T035 [US3] Verify all tests pass

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
