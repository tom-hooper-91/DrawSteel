# Specification Quality Checklist: Update and Delete Character API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality checks passed successfully:

- **Content Quality**: Specification is written for business stakeholders without implementation details (no mentions of C#, ASP.NET, MongoDB, etc.)
- **Requirements**: All 12 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- **Success Criteria**: All 7 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can successfully update a character's name in under 2 seconds")
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: 8 acceptance scenarios cover all primary user flows
- **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Assumptions**: 8 assumptions documented, providing clarity on scope and defaults
- **No Clarifications Needed**: Specification is complete with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.
