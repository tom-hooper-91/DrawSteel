# Feature Specification: Update and Delete Character API

**Feature Branch**: `001-character-api`  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want an update and delete Character API"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Update Character Name (Priority: P1)

A user wants to modify an existing character's name after creation, allowing them to correct mistakes or update character information as their game progresses.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested and provides immediate value. Users frequently need to correct typos or update character names as campaigns evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a character, calling the update endpoint with a new name, and verifying the character's name changed while preserving other data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a character exists with ID "123" and name "Aragorn", **When** user updates the character name to "Strider", **Then** the character's name is changed to "Strider" and the ID remains "123"
2. **Given** a character exists, **When** user updates the character with valid data, **Then** the system returns a success response with the updated character information
3. **Given** a character exists, **When** user updates the character name to an empty string, **Then** the system rejects the update with an appropriate error message

---

### User Story 2 - Delete Character (Priority: P2)

A user wants to permanently remove a character from the system when it's no longer needed, such as when a character dies in the campaign or when cleaning up test data.

**Why this priority**: Essential for data management and user control, but secondary to update functionality since users typically update characters more frequently than deleting them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a character, calling the delete endpoint, verifying the character no longer exists, and confirming subsequent attempts to retrieve or delete return appropriate responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a character exists with ID "123", **When** user deletes the character, **Then** the character is removed from the system
2. **Given** a character was deleted, **When** user attempts to retrieve the deleted character, **Then** the system returns a not found response
3. **Given** a character exists, **When** user deletes the character, **Then** the system returns a success response confirming deletion

---

### User Story 3 - Safe Update Operations (Priority: P3)

A user attempts to update a character that doesn't exist or has been deleted, and receives clear feedback about why the operation failed.

**Why this priority**: Important for user experience and system robustness, but less critical than core functionality. Helps prevent confusion when concurrent operations occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to update non-existent character IDs and verifying appropriate error responses are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no character exists with ID "999", **When** user attempts to update character "999", **Then** the system returns a not found response
2. **Given** a character with invalid ID format is provided, **When** user attempts to update it, **Then** the system returns a validation error

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user attempts to delete an already deleted character?
- How does the system handle concurrent update requests to the same character?
- What happens when a user provides an invalid character ID format (non-GUID)?
- How does the system handle update requests with partial data (only name vs. all fields)?
- What happens when network interruption occurs during update or delete operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an endpoint to update an existing character's information
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an endpoint to delete an existing character
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that the character exists before allowing update operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that the character exists before allowing delete operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST require a valid character identifier for all update and delete operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent updates with invalid or empty character names
- **FR-007**: System MUST return appropriate success responses when update or delete operations complete successfully
- **FR-008**: System MUST return appropriate error responses when operations fail (character not found, validation errors, etc.)
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist character updates so they are reflected in subsequent retrieval operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure deleted characters cannot be retrieved or modified after deletion
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle idempotent delete operations (deleting an already deleted character should not cause an error)
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate the format of character identifiers before processing requests

### Key Entities

- **Character**: Represents a game character with a unique identifier and name. The character can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted. Related to CharacterId for identification purposes.
- **CharacterId**: A unique identifier for each character, used to reference specific characters across all operations.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully update a character's name in under 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: Users can successfully delete a character in under 2 seconds
- **SC-003**: System returns appropriate error responses within 1 second when operations fail
- **SC-004**: 100% of update operations persist data correctly so subsequent retrievals reflect changes
- **SC-005**: 100% of delete operations remove data correctly so subsequent retrievals return not found
- **SC-006**: System handles at least 100 concurrent update/delete requests without data corruption
- **SC-007**: API responses follow consistent format across all operations (create, read, update, delete)

## Assumptions

- Character updates are limited to the name field based on current Character entity structure
- Character identifiers are GUIDs based on existing implementation
- Update operations are full replacements (not partial/patch updates)
- Standard HTTP status codes are used (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error)
- No authentication or authorization is required at this stage (matching current API implementation)
- Soft deletes are not required; deletion is permanent
- No audit trail or history tracking is needed for updates or deletes
- Concurrent operations follow last-write-wins pattern
